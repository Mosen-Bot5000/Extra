    <div class="paragraph">The year was 1999, and the country was in a pickle. No one knew what's what. Then, a bright young spark by the name of Mitch Rosen had a bright idea. It was music, but made up of electronic noises. He took his entirely original idea to his friends and, together, they formed Light Emitting Dioide (or LED for short). The band's first album was an instant success. They immidiately formed a large <i>cult</i> following. <BR><br>
        
     In the years following, the group went on to release such well known hits as "Ampersand Man", "Blinding Lights" and "https://mosenled.github.io/Extra/"<br><Br>
